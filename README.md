# edge264-mvc

edge264 is a cross-platform, open-source H.264/AVC **software** decoder, focused on **speed** and **ease of use**.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a maintained fork of [tvlabs/edge264](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264). It powers:
> - **[Oku3D Media Player](https://oku3d.com/)** - a native 3D media player that plays 3D Blu-rays (MVC) and converts any 2D video to stereoscopic 3D in real time.
> - **[mvc-source](https://github.com/jens-duttke/mvc-source)** - a dependency-free AviSynth+ & VapourSynth source plugin that frame-serves both MVC views for 3D video processing on Linux and Windows.
>
> edge264-mvc makes the **MVC / H.264 Annex H decode path (3D Blu-ray, stereo)** actually work end to end:
> FFmpeg / libavcodec drop the MVC dependent view entirely, so this is the only viable open-source
> *software* MVC decoder. Stock edge264's MVC path had several bugs whose fixing PRs sat open for
> months; this fork integrates those, adds many more MVC-correctness and decode-robustness fixes, and
> implements working **multithreaded decoding** (bit-exact to single-thread, validated on the full
> 231-stream JVT conformance corpus).

*Benchmark computed as the fastest of 10 runs of [Big Buck Bunny test video](https://test-videos.co.uk/vids/bigbuckbunny/mp4/h264/1080/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_30MB.mp4),
on GitHub-hosted runners. Each decoder is timed both single-threaded (`1T`) and multithreaded
(`MT`, all auto-detected cores) for a fair comparison at both ends; OpenH264's decoder has no
multithreading, so it is shown once. All times are wall-clock - the MT speedup is bounded by the
runner's few vCPUs, so a many-core machine gains more.*


## Features

edge264 decodes the **Progressive High** and **Stereo High (MVC 3D)** profiles, up to level 6.2. Both the **MVC 3D** path and **multithreaded decoding** are fully functional here; stock edge264 ships the same code but both are broken (see [Relation to edge264](#relation-to-edge264)).

Below is an overview of optional features versus Baseline (**BP**), Extended (**XP**), Main (**MP**), High (**HP**) and Stereo High (**SHP**) profiles. Features outside the **Progressive High** and **Stereo High** scope (higher bit depths, 4:2:2/4:4:4 chroma, interlaced coding) are intentionally out of scope and well covered by general-purpose decoders such as FFmpeg; edge264's focus is the MVC 3D path that FFmpeg cannot decode.

## Platforms

Target system support currently includes **macOS**, **Linux**, **Windows** and **WebAssembly**.

Processor support depends on the compiler used (GNU GCC or LLVM Clang). edge264 can choose among 4 backends, the last one supporting every other little-endian CPU by relying on [Clang vector extensions](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#vectors-and-extended-vectors).

| Compiler | Intel x86/x64 | ARM32/64+NEON | WASM32/64 v2+ | Other ISAs |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Clang | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (v15+) |
| GCC | ✓ | ✓ | | |


## Building

For native builds:

```sh
make
```

For WebAssembly builds:

```sh
emmake make # add CFLAGS=-mrelaxed-simd to target WASM v3
```

You can find lists of targets and options and what they do in the [Makefile](Makefile).

The `VARIANTS` option allows shipping multiple builds inside a single library file. It is intended for distribution packages that must run efficiently across a wide range of x86 CPUs: the library detects the host ISA level at runtime and dispatches to the fastest available implementation. They are *not* needed for a native single-machine build, where `-march=native` already picks the best code path at compile time. For example:

```sh
make CFLAGS="-march=x86-64" VARIANTS=x86-64-v2,x86-64-v3 BUILDTEST=no
```

### CMake integration

edge264 ships a `CMakeLists.txt` that wraps its Makefile, so you can
integrate it into a CMake project without writing any custom build logic.
It exposes a single imported target `edge264::edge264` for use with
`target_link_libraries`.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(my_app C)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(edge264
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/jens-duttke/edge264-mvc.git
  GIT_TAG        v2026.06.27  # always pin to a tag or commit hash
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(edge264)

add_executable(my_app main.c)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE edge264::edge264)
```


## Usage

```sh
make
./edge264_test --help # prints all options available
ffmpeg -i vid.mp4 -vcodec copy -bsf h264_mp4toannexb -an vid.264 # optional, converts from MP4 format
./edge264_test -d vid.264 # replace -d with -b to benchmark instead of display
```

### Transcoding (piping decoded frames to an encoder)

`edge264_test -o` writes the decoded frames to standard output as a self-describing [YUV4MPEG2 (Y4M)](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/YUV4MPEG2) stream (dimensions and frame rate in the header), so it pipes straight into any encoder. This is the practical way to re-encode a stream FFmpeg cannot decode - in particular an **MVC 3D Blu-ray**, whose dependent view FFmpeg drops:

```sh
# 2D: re-encode the base view
./edge264_test movie.264 -o | ffmpeg -i - -c:v libx264 -crf 18 out.mp4

# 3D: -O writes the two views side by side (base | dependent) as one frame.
# There is no open MVC encoder, so a frame-compatible side-by-side H.264 (playable
# on any 3D display) is the realistic single-file 3D output; frame-packing=3 tags it.
./edge264_test movie.264 -O | ffmpeg -i - -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -x264opts frame-packing=3 out_sbs3d.mp4
```

Real 3D Blu-rays carry per-access-unit unspecified NALs (type 24) that return `ENOTSUP`; add `-k` so the decode runs to the end instead of stopping at the first one (`-ok` / `-Ok`). The frame rate is taken from the stream's VUI and can be overridden downstream (`ffmpeg -r ...`).

The input path can also be `-` to read an Annex B stream from standard input, so a demuxer can pipe straight into the decoder without a temporary file (`demux ... | edge264_test - -O | ffmpeg -i - ...`); on POSIX a named pipe (FIFO) path works the same way. Stream input is buffered one NAL unit at a time (capped at 64 MiB), while regular files stay on the memory-mapped fast path.

Here is a complete example that opens an input file in Annex B byte stream format from the command line, and dumps its decoded frames in planar YUV order to standard output. See [edge264_test.c](src/edge264_test.c) for a more complete example which can also display frames.

	const uint8_t *end = buf + st.st_size;
	// auto threads, no logs, auto allocs
	Edge264Decoder *dec = edge264_alloc(-1, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL);

		while (!edge264_get_frame(dec, &frm, 0)) {
			for (int y = 0; y < frm.height_Y; y++)
				write(1, frm.samples[0] + y * frm.stride_Y, frm.width_Y);
			for (int y = 0; y < frm.height_C; y++)
				write(1, frm.samples[1] + y * frm.stride_C, frm.width_C);
			for (int y = 0; y < frm.height_C; y++)
				write(1, frm.samples[2] + y * frm.stride_C, frm.width_C);
		}
		if (res != ENOBUFS)
			nal = start_code + 3;
	} while (res == 0 || res == ENOBUFS);
	edge264_free(&dec);
	munmap(buf, st.st_size);
	close(fd);
	return 0;
}
```

> * `EBADMSG` - invalid stream (decoding may proceed but could show visual artefacts, if you can check with another decoder that the stream is actually flawless, please consider filling a bug report 🙏)
> * `EINVAL` - the function was called with `dec == NULL` or `buf == NULL`
> * `ENODATA` - the function was called with `buf >= end` and there are no frames left to output
> * `ENOMEM` - `malloc` failed to allocate memory

<code>int <b>edge264_get_frame</b>(dec, out, borrow)</code>

> Fetch the next frame ready for output.
> * `Edge264Decoder * dec` - initialized decoding context
> * `Edge264Frame *out` - a structure that will be filled with data for the frame returned
> * `int borrow` - if 0 the frame may be accessed until the next call to `edge264_decode_NAL`, otherwise the frame should be explicitly returned with `edge264_return_frame`. Note that access is not exclusive, it may be used concurrently as reference for other frames.

> The four `Poc` / `DisplayPoc` fields are edge264-mvc's addition to the original edge264 API: `Poc` / `Poc_mvc` are the per-view picture order counts, and `DisplayPoc` / `DisplayPoc_mvc` their stream-monotonic unwrapped values. MVC frames are returned POC-paired (`samples` + `samples_mvc`), in display order.

> * `Edge264Decoder ** pdec` - pointer to a decoding context, initialized or not


## Validation and tests

`make check` builds the decoder and runs the full test suite:

```sh
make check
```

It covers a synthetic suite (tiny generated bitstreams with pixel-exact intra/inter asserts) plus several committed regression suites that edge264-mvc adds on top of stock edge264:

- **Conformance** ([`tests/conformance`](tests/conformance)) - decodes a curated subset of real JVT conformance bitstreams and compares each stream's per-view output to a committed hash anchored to the official ITU reference YUVs, together with the MVC structural guarantees (POC pairing, display order). It ships the expected hashes, so a fresh clone runs it fully offline.
- **Liveness** ([`tests/liveness`](tests/liveness)) - decodes damaged real-world streams (truncated captures, dropped or corrupt NALs) behind a progress guard, asserting the decoder always makes forward progress instead of stalling or deadlocking.
- **Memory safety** ([`tests/asan`](tests/asan)) - decodes crafted-SEI fixtures under AddressSanitizer (`make SANITIZE=address check-asan`).
- **Stream input** ([`tests/stream_input_check.py`](tests/stream_input_check.py)) - decodes small MVC fixtures from a regular file, standard input (`-`), and a POSIX FIFO, asserting byte-identical Y4M output across all three (and across single- and multi-threaded decoding), so the incremental stream reader stays in lockstep with the memory-mapped fast path. A large filler NAL exercises the buffer-growth path that a real above-64 KiB keyframe hits.
- **Forced-flush guard** ([`tests/edge264_test_liveness.py`](tests/edge264_test_liveness.py)) - fills the DPB with unfinished pictures so ordinary `ENOBUFS` draining makes no progress, then asserts `edge264_test`'s caller-side progress guard forces an end-of-stream drain and emits the exact expected frames, through both the regular-file and stdin paths in single- and multi-threaded modes. A timeout turns a regressed spin into a failure.
- **Multithreading** - every conformance and liveness fixture is also decoded with background worker threads and asserted bit-exact to the single-threaded output.

On the full set of AVCv1, FRExt and MVC [conformance bitstreams](https://www.itu.int/wftp3/av-arch/jvt-site/draft_conformance/) (231 streams), edge264 decodes 113 bit-exact against the ITU reference YUVs, 114 use yet-unsupported features, and 4 fail - the same result as stock edge264, with multithreaded output bit-exact to single-thread on every supported stream.

For ad-hoc testing and display, `edge264_test` can browse files in a given directory, decoding each `<video>.264` file and comparing its output with each sibling file `<video>.yuv` if found.

<summary>Test roadmap - implemented tests carry a file name, the rest are planned</summary>

edge264-mvc's own tests - MVC conformance, real-world decode robustness, memory safety and multithreading - live in [`tests/conformance`](tests/conformance), [`tests/liveness`](tests/liveness) and [`tests/asan`](tests/asan) (described above) and run under `make check`. The synthetic per-branch matrix below is the original edge264's roadmap; edge264-mvc has begun filling in the MVC rows it has fixtures for (see [`tests/conformance/mvc-synthetic`](tests/conformance/mvc-synthetic)).

## Design

edge264 was created to experiment with programming techniques that improve performance and reduce code size over existing decoders; several of them were presented at [FOSDEM'24](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2931-innovations-in-h-264-avc-software-decoding-architecture-and-optimization-of-a-block-based-video-decoder-to-reach-10-faster-speed-and-3x-code-reduction-over-the-state-of-the-art-/), [FOSDEM'25](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5455-more-innovations-in-h-264-avc-software-decoding/) and [FOSDEM'26](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ADXJMU-innovations-with-yaml-cabac-simd-in-h264-decoding/).

1. [Single header file](src/edge264_internal.h) - It contains all struct definitions, common constants and enums, SIMD aliases, inline functions and macros, and exported functions for each source file. To understand the code base you should look at this file first.
2. [Code blocks instead of functions](src/edge264_slice.c) - The main decoding loop is a forward pipeline designed as a DAG loosely resembling hardware decoders, with nodes being non-inlined functions and edges being tail calls. It helps mutualize code branches wherever possible, thus reduces code size to help fit in L1 cache.
3. [Tree branching](src/edge264_intra.c) - Directional intra modes are implemented with a jump table to the leaves of a tree then unconditional jumps down to the trunk. It allows sharing the bottom code among directional modes, to reduce code size.
4. ~~Global context register - The pointer to the main structure holding context data is assigned to a register when supported by the compiler (GCC).~~ This technique was dropped as Clang eventually reached on-par performance, so there is little incentive to maintain this hack.
5. [Default neighboring values](src/edge264_internal.h) (search `unavail_mb`) - Tests for availability of neighbors are replaced with fake neighboring macroblocks around each frame. It reduces the number of conditional tests inside the main decoding loop, thus reduces code size and branch predictor pressure.
6. [Relative neighboring offsets](src/edge264_internal.h) (look for `A4x4_int8` and related variables) - Access to left/top macroblock values is done with direct offsets in memory instead of copying their values to a buffer beforehand. It helps to reduce the reads and writes in the main decoding loop.
7. [Parsing uneven block shapes](src/edge264_slice.c) (look at function `parse_P_sub_mb`) - Each Inter macroblock paving specified with mb_type and sub_mb_type is first converted to a bitmask, then iterated on set bits to fetch the correct number of reference indices and motion vectors. This helps to reduce code size and number of conditional blocks.
8. [Using vector extensions](src/edge264_internal.h) - GCC's vector extensions are used along vector intrinsics to write more compact code. All intrinsics from Intel are aliased with shorter names, which also provides an enumeration of all SIMD instructions used in the decoder.
9. [Register-saturating SIMD](src/edge264_deblock.c) - Some critical SIMD algorithms use more simultaneous vectors than available registers, effectively saturating the register bank and generating stack spills on purpose. In some cases this is more efficient than splitting the algorithm into smaller bits, and has the additional benefit of scaling well with later CPUs.
10. [Piston cached bitstream reader](src/edge264_bitstream.c) - The bitstream bits are read in a size_t\[2\] intermediate cache with a trailing set bit to keep track of the number of cached bits, giving access to 32/64 bits per read from the cache, and allowing wide refills from memory.
11. [On-the-fly SIMD unescaping](src/edge264_bitstream.c) - The input bitstream is unescaped on the fly using vector code, avoiding a full preprocessing pass to remove escape sequences, and thus reducing memory reads/writes.
12. [Multiarch SIMD programming](src/edge264_internal.h) - Using vector extensions along with aliased intrinsics allows supporting both Intel SSE and ARM NEON with around 80% common code and few #if #else blocks, while keeping state-of-the-art performance for both architectures.
13. [The Structure of Arrays pattern](src/edge264_internal.h) - The frame buffer is stored with arrays for each distinct field rather than an array of structures, to express operations on frames with bitwise and vector operators (see [AoS and SoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA)). The task buffer for multithreading also relies on it partially.
14. [Deferred error checking](src/edge264_headers.c) - Error detection is performed once in each type of NAL unit (search for `return` statements), by clamping all input values to their expected ranges, then expecting `rbsp_trailing_bit` afterwards (with _very high_ probability of catching an error if the stream is corrupted). This design choice is detailed in [A case about parsing errors](https://traffaillac.github.io/parsing.html).
15. [YAML logging output](src/edge264_headers.c) - The YAML format is used for logging, which makes debugging easier, enables reencoding (used for creation of custom bitstreams) and data analysis.
16. [CABAC decoding](src/edge264_bitstream.c) - The CABAC internal state is extended to use the full bit range of CPU registers, allowing less frequent renormalization trips to memory, and the batch-decoding of *bypass* bits with a hardware division.


## Relation to edge264

edge264-mvc is a standalone decoder derived from [tvlabs/edge264](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264) by Thibault Raffaillac, which grew up as a research effort on new software engineering practices (most notably C vector extensions in place of hand-crafted assembly). `main` adds the fixes below on top of the edge264 codebase; each fix also lives on its own `fix/*`, `pick/*` or `port/*` branch, and cherry-picked PRs keep their original authorship.

Multithreaded decoding is the headline addition. Call `edge264_alloc` with `n_threads = -1` to auto-detect cores (the default in `edge264_test`) or a positive thread count, or `n_threads = 0` for the single-threaded path. Stock edge264's experimental multi-thread path was broken (pre-existing, reproducible on pristine edge264 even for non-MVC streams - a teardown deadlock, out-of-order output, an MVC stereo-pairing stall and data races); edge264-mvc makes multithreaded output **bit-exact to single-thread on every supported stream of the 231-stream JVT corpus**, hang-free under heavy thread oversubscription, and ThreadSanitizer-clean. It also keeps PR #25's single-threaded decode-hang fix ([PR #25](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264/pull/25) · @intrepidsilence, `ready_tasks == 0`). The API is the original edge264's plus four POC fields on `Edge264Frame` (`Poc`, `Poc_mvc`, `DisplayPoc`, `DisplayPoc_mvc`).

**MVC / stereo correctness** - the reason this project exists; verified on three commercial 1080p MVC streams with **0 pairing / 0 ordering errors over 2,500+ frame pairs**:

| MVC view mispairing at a mid-stream IDR (dependent view dropped each GOP) | edge264-mvc |
| MVC same-POC view mispairing (non-deterministic dependent view under multithreading / paced DPB overflow) | edge264-mvc |
| MVC inter-view reference appended before the RefPicList1-vs-RefPicList0 swap (wrong dependent-view L1 / direct-mode reference on a single-temporal-reference B slice) | edge264-mvc |
| MVC per-view MMCO5 reset cleared the co-decoded view's long-term frame indices (marking must be per view component) | edge264-mvc |
| Keep the exported display POC strictly monotonic across real-world POC discontinuities (open-GOP LSB wrap and same-POC access units on commercial 3D Blu-rays) | edge264-mvc |
| MVC deep-B two-view output deadlock / C.4.5 fullness abort (the output-buffer gate counted both view queues against one 16-slot budget, halving MVC capacity below the reorder window; a GOP16 hierarchical-B stream that filled both view reference sets then deadlocked under multithreading and aborted in debug) | edge264-mvc |
| MVC base-view display-order swap on a stream coded decode-order != display-order (a reverse-pairing pass queued a base when its dependent was seen, i.e. in decode order, stamping its display rank out of order; output is now strictly base-driven, so the base view again matches FFmpeg) | edge264-mvc |
| MVC multithreaded deadlock on a base-less dependent-view tail, as a byte-trimmed 3D-BD stream or an unequal-length two-file base+dependent feed produces (the orphan-dependent liveness valve dropped a dependent view whose decode tasks were still running - or that was still being parsed - freeing its DPB slot for reallocation while the stale tasks still wrote it; their `remaining_mbs` subtractions corrupted the new occupant's completion counter, dependent slices misfired `EBADMSG`, the frame never finalized, and once every task slot waited on it `edge264_decode_NAL` blocked forever at 0% CPU. The valve now defers the drop until the dependent has no in-flight tasks, and the slot allocator refuses any slot still written by a busy task) | edge264-mvc |

**Decode robustness on real-world streams** - found by a broad decode audit over a large, heterogeneous sample corpus (crashes, hangs, wrong output and decode failures that the synthetic and conformance suites do not exercise). Each carries a committed regression fixture ([`tests/liveness`](tests/liveness), [`tests/asan`](tests/asan) or [`tests/conformance`](tests/conformance)) and is **inert on the full JVT conformance set** (identical results before and after, zero regressions); each was verified against FFmpeg on real captures:

| Fix | Failure mode it removes |
|---|---|
| Floor `max_num_ref_frames` at 1 so a reference IDR fits the DPB | reference IDR didn't fit the DPB (C.4.5 fullness assert) |
| Floor derived `max_dec_frame_buffering` at the reference count | a resolution-exceeds-signaled-level stream aborted a C.4.5 assert |
| Keep the signaled `max_num_ref_frames` on an over-level stream (bound by DPB capacity, not the level) | a frame-exceeds-signaled-level stream clamped its reference set below the count its own slices use - silently wrong inter prediction (single-thread) and a nondeterministic multithreaded decode |
| Report an FMO PPS (`num_slice_groups > 1`) as `ENOTSUP` instead of a decode error | the unparsed slice-group map left the bit position mid-syntax, so the PPS misfired `EBADMSG` - a valid but unsupported stream looked corrupt instead of cleanly skippable |
| Read `frame_mbs_only_flag` before bounding `pic_height_in_map_units` | tall progressive frames clamped / stalled |
| Reject `frame_num` gap with no reclaimable slot (instead of aborting) | a frame-num gap aborted the decoder |
| Harden SEI parsing against crafted `payloadType` / `payloadSize` | out-of-bounds read / multi-second CPU burn on a crafted SEI |
| Skip an unhandled SEI message by its cache-aware bit count, not the refill pointer | a small trailing SEI that fit entirely in the bitstream cache (a `recovery_point` closing a base-view access unit, as commercial 3D Blu-rays carry) was not advanced past, so its payload was re-parsed as bogus follow-on messages and misfired `EBADMSG`, failing an otherwise valid stream in the header-logging / trace path |
| Advance past a *handled* SEI message by its declared `payloadSize`, not just byte-alignment | a handled SEI message that consumed fewer bytes than its `payloadSize` (a short-reading or forward-compatible payload with trailing reserved data) left the tail in the stream, re-parsed as bogus follow-on messages, so the reader overran the RBSP trailing and misfired `EBADMSG` on a valid stream (the mirror of the unhandled-message skip above, on the success path) |
| Emit an incomplete final picture at end-of-stream | a capture truncated mid-frame (broadcast TS/M2TS) deadlocked the drain |
| Recover an orphaned undelivered picture on a flush drain | a corrupt-slice frame stalled the DPB and lost the last picture |
| Flush held pictures at an `end_of_sequence` NAL, not only at the end of the buffer (`parse_end_of_sequence` now sets the same flushing valve the end-of-buffer drain uses) | a multi-clip 3D player that ends a clip on its `end_of_sequence` unit, whose trailing MVC base view had no paired dependent, left that base held and spun `ENOBUFS` in the draining caller - losing the clip's last base frame instead of emitting it |
| Clamp out-of-range RefPicList entries | stack overrun / access violation on a non-conformant ref list |
| Reject a base-less inter-coded MVC dependent-view slice (type 20, P/B) whose base view was never decoded | a stream carrying dependent-view slices but no decodable base view (no base-view SPS) left every dependent slice's inter-view reference resolving to its own not-yet-decoded frame slot, so its decode task depended on its own picture; multithreaded, those self-dependent tasks piled up until the parser deadlocked waiting for a free task slot and `edge264_decode_NAL` never returned (FFmpeg likewise reports the missing base view and produces no frame) |
| Tolerate a VUI that over-reads past the SPS rbsp | whole stream dropped over a common encoder defect |
| Tolerate a CABAC slice that over-reads past its NAL when complete | a dense 4K multi-slice CABAC frame stalled mid-stream |
| Tolerate non-1 `cabac_alignment_one_bit` padding | every slice rejected -> mid-stream stall, 0 frames |
| Reject a slice whose `first_mb_in_slice` is outside the current picture | out-of-bounds macroblock write / crash when interleaved multi-resolution streams (e.g. main + secondary/PiP video) reach one decoder |
| Fall back to the Default scaling matrices (Fall-Back Rule Set A, Table 7-2) when a PPS declares `pic_scaling_matrix_present_flag = 1` with absent lists over a `seq_scaling_matrix_present_flag = 0` SPS | the absent PPS lists inherited the SPS's `Flat_16` instead of the spec-mandated `Default_4x4`/`Default_8x8` weighting, so a High Profile stream using this (legal, common) combination dequantized every coefficient wrong - whole-picture colour-block corruption that a commercial 3D Blu-ray's MVC stream showed in **both** views (the base view is mis-decoded in the plain AVC path, and the dependent view inherits it through inter-view prediction) |

**Spec conformance & cross-ISA correctness** - decoder-correctness fixes verified arithmetically or by construction against the H.264 spec and the other SIMD backends rather than by a captured stream. None is observed on a real capture or the JVT conformance set (they cover spec-boundary cases, high-QP / custom-scaling-matrix arithmetic, cross-SIMD-backend bit-exactness and undefined-behaviour hardening); each is **inert on the full JVT conformance set** (identical results before and after):

| Fix | Failure mode it removes |
|---|---|
| Round SSE temporal-direct motion vectors with the spec's +128 bias | a signed `DistScaleFactor` sign-extended into the packed rounding constant, biasing the round to +129 for every negative scale factor (the ordinary "current picture between the collocated picture and its reference" case), so B-slice and MVC inter-view direct motion vectors on the shipped x86/SSE build diverged by up to one quarter-pel from the NEON / WASM / scalar backends |
| Derive the POC of inferred `frame_num`-gap frames the same way as the main path for `pic_order_cnt_type == 1` | the gap-fill loop multiplied by `PicOrderCntDeltas[cycle]` (one past the only written entries `[0..cycle-1]`, reading into the next SPS field at the maximum cycle of 255) and dropped the `-1` on the cycle quotient and remainder, so a synthesized non-existing reference frame got a wrong POC |
| Dequantize high-QP 8x8 residuals at 32-bit precision | the `qP >= 36` branch scaled `weightScale8x8 * normAdjust8x8` up in 16-bit lanes; with a custom (non-flat) 8x8 scaling matrix at qP 49-51 the shift overflowed int16 and wrapped to a sign-flipped operand -> garbage dequantized coefficients (the `qP < 36` branch and the 4x4 path already scale at 32 bits) |
| Guard the 8.2.5.3 sliding-window marking on a short-term reference actually existing | a non-conformant stream that filled every reference slot with long-term frames (short-term count 0) made the process fabricate a short-term reference at slot 0 and demote it out of the long-term set, corrupting the reference set |
| Guard the default frame allocator against `NULL + size` pointer arithmetic on a failed allocation | undefined behaviour on OOM (masked by the caller's NULL check, but flagged by UBSan / strict builds) |
| Clamp the portable-C (non-SIMD) `pow2x4` shift count and saturate its `temporal_scale` narrow | on the non-shipped generic-vector backend, `1 << (negative count)` for an empty-`RefPicList` slot was UB (masked to 0 afterwards) and the motion-vector narrow truncated where SSE / NEON / WASM saturate - the shipped backends were already correct |

**Multithreaded decoding** - stock edge264's background-thread path was unusable; these make it bit-exact to single-thread and hang-free, validated over the full JVT corpus and with ThreadSanitizer. All are inert in the single-threaded path (`n_threads = 0`):

| Fix | Failure mode it removes |
|---|---|
| Join worker threads on teardown instead of cancel-and-destroy | `edge264_free` deadlocked in `cnd_destroy` after every multithreaded decode |
| Hold an MVC base frame until its lagging dependent view is ready | dependent view stranded in its queue -> hard stall on MVC streams under thread contention |
| Emit frames in monotonic display order, waiting on the in-flight earliest | out-of-order output / ballooning `DisplayPoc` across a GOP boundary under multithreading |
| Make `next_deblock_addr` accesses atomic (acquire/release) | data race on the deblock-frontier / completion flag (benign on x86-64, torn/stale on ARM) |
| Persist the auto-detected logical-core count so teardown joins every worker | `edge264_alloc(-1)` left the raw `-1` in the join-loop bound, so `edge264_free` joined no workers and freed the decoder under still-live threads (teardown access violation, surfaced on the Windows/MinGW build) |
| Clamp the requested worker count to the fixed-size thread pool | an explicit `n_threads` above 16 overran the internal 16-slot `threads` array in the spawn and join loops |
| Copy slice NALs into decoder-owned memory so worker threads outlive the caller's buffer | a caller that reused or freed its NAL buffer once `decode_NAL` returned (correct single-threaded, where decoding is synchronous) corrupted the slice still being decoded by a background worker - CABAC desync, then a DPB stall, on real multi-slice MVC streams |
| Run pending tasks' unref callbacks on teardown | a slice NAL copied for an asynchronous worker but not yet taken by one leaked when `edge264_free` stopped the workers (only the flush path drained them) |
| Make the DPB bump sequence deterministic: queue an MVC dependent view on the parsing thread as soon as its base is queued, give the immediate-output bump a display rank, and hold a picture whose slices are still being parsed | multithreaded output order varied from run to run around IDR/GOP boundaries on real MVC streams (every frame decoded correctly, but emitted in a schedule-dependent order): `get_frame`'s consumer-side pairing valve fired on worker timing and perturbed the parse-side bump triggers, the then-reachable immediate-output path reused a stale display rank so a new GOP's IDR overtook queued frames, and a multi-slice picture could momentarily escape the display-order hold between two of its slices |
| Conceal a terminal incomplete dependency before any task-completion wait | an asynchronously failed or truncated reference slice left `remaining_mbs > 0` after its last writer exited; later slices waited on that frame while every worker slept because no task was ready, deadlocking at task-pool saturation, EOS/flush, or DPB-slot pressure (the synchronous path's no-ready-task safety net kept progressing) |

**Build / cross-compile** - the Windows DLL is cross-built with MinGW-w64; wasm via Node:

| Fix | Source |
|---|---|
| Route aligned allocations through a MinGW-compatible CRT pair (`_aligned_malloc`/`_aligned_free`) | edge264-mvc |
| Stop MinGW's `stdlib.h` `min`/`max` macros from shadowing the typed helpers | edge264-mvc |
| Probe Node for relaxed-SIMD flag support in the wasm `make check` | edge264-mvc |
| Guard the multithreaded ref-dependency mask against empty `RefPicList` slots on the portable non-SIMD path | [issue #28](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264/issues/28) |
| Pair `-march=native` with `-mtune=generic` on native builds - GCC's per-microarch cost model schedules measurably slower code than generic tuning for this hand-written-SIMD codebase (bit-exact; cross-compiled / `-march=x86-64-v*` distribution builds already tune generic and are unaffected) | edge264-mvc |

**Deliberately not included:**

- [PR #26](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264/pull/26) (scaling-matrix defaults): the
  full JVT conformance run shows it breaks 5 High Profile streams with
  `seq_scaling_matrix_present_flag = 0` (the spec mandates flat-16 for the SPS's own
  lists there, and `parse_scaling_lists` already implements the value cascade correctly).
  Note this is a different case from the genuine PPS fall-back bug fixed above: PR #26
  wrongly changed the *SPS* flat-16 default, whereas the fix above corrects which
  fall-back rule set (A vs B) applies when a *PPS* declares its own scaling matrix.
- Unspecified NAL types (0, 24-31) - including the type-24 units some 3D Blu-rays carry
  ([issue #20](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264/issues/20)) - return `ENOTSUP` by design,
  matching stock edge264's tested contract. Skip them in your decode loop rather than treating them
  as fatal (a caller-side concern, not a library change).
